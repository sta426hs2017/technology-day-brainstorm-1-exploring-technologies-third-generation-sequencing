# 3rd generation sequencing

### Summary

Third generation sequencing is a method to determine the order of bases
of a DNA strand using a single molecule, compared to breakdown and
subsequent amplification of the DNA with predecessing techniques.
Advantages include longer read lengths, faster run time
and lower cost, yet challenges remain in accuracy.
