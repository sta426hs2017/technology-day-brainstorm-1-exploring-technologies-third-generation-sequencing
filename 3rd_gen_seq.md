# 3rd generation sequencing

### Summary

Third generation sequencing is a method to determine the order of bases
of a DNA strand using a single molecule, compared to breakdown and
subsequent amplification of the DNA with predecessing techniques.

#### Advantages

- Longer reads
- Directly detect Epigenetics markers
- Portability and sequencing speed

#### Challenges

- High error rate
